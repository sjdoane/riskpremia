"""Stationary block bootstrap for path uncertainty (ADR 0016 decision 5).

The M5 study's genuine path-uncertainty tool. CPCV's reconstructed paths
coincide for a deterministic factor (ADR 0016 decision 4), so the honest
path-uncertainty surface is a resampling bootstrap of the realized return
series. The STATIONARY block bootstrap (Politis and Romano 1994) resamples
the series in geometrically-distributed-length blocks, which preserves the
short-range serial dependence momentum returns carry; an iid bootstrap
would understate path variance by destroying that autocorrelation.

The stationary variant is chosen over the moving-block (Kunsch 1989) and
circular-block bootstraps because its random geometric block lengths make
the resampled series strictly stationary, avoiding the fixed-block-length
artifacts of the former and the period-wrap distortion of the latter.

Determinism and dependencies: this module uses the Python standard library
`random.Random(seed)` only. The analytics layer is deliberately stdlib-only
(ADR 0013 decision 11), and ADR 0016 decision 5 specifies `random.Random`
with an explicit seed for the bootstrap. `docs/methodology/determinism.md`
Requirement 2 bans module-level RNG in the `signal` and `policy` layers (the
engine plumbs a seeded generator); the analytics layer is the explicit
carve-out, so an explicitly-seeded `random.Random` here is consistent, not a
violation. The seed and the two per-step draws (a continuation test then a
restart draw) are the only randomness, and CPython's `random.Random` is
reproducible across runs for a fixed seed and call sequence.

Block-length selection: `politis_white_block_length` implements the Politis
and White (2004) / Patton, Politis and White (2009) automatic data-driven
choice of `expected_block_length` from a flat-top lag-window spectral estimate
(stdlib-only, a faithful transcription of the canonical `arch` implementation).
The momentum study reports its raw value and applies a conservative minimal
floor; on the real monthly series the selector judges the returns near-iid (it
overrides the isolated boundary-crossing lag the +/- 2/sqrt(n) ACF rule would
treat as significant), a stronger and more honest result than a hand-chosen
block length.

    """Resample `returns` into `n_paths` synthetic series of the same length.

    Each synthetic series is built by concatenating geometric-length blocks
    drawn (with wrap-around) from `returns`, with mean block length
    `expected_block_length`. The block-continuation probability is
    `p = 1 / expected_block_length`: at each position the next value either
    continues the current block (probability `1 - p`, advance the index with
    wrap-around) or starts a new block at a uniformly-random index
    (probability `p`).

    Args:
      returns: the realized per-period return series to resample. Must be
        non-empty.
      n_paths: how many synthetic series to generate. Must be >= 1.
      expected_block_length: the mean geometric block length. Must be > 1.0;
        `expected_block_length == 1.0` degenerates to the iid bootstrap (and
        `p = 1` would restart every step), which the stationary bootstrap
        exists to avoid, so it is rejected.
      seed: the `random.Random` seed for reproducibility. Must be an `int`
        (a `bool` is rejected explicitly; `True`/`False` as a seed is almost
        certainly a caller bug).

    Returns:
      A list of `n_paths` synthetic return series, each of length
      `len(returns)`, with `float` values drawn from `returns`.

    Raises:
      ValueError: per the loud-failure discipline (ADR 0013 decision 7) on a
        non-int (or bool) seed, empty `returns`, `n_paths < 1`, or
        `expected_block_length` not strictly greater than 1.0 (this also

    """Politis-White automatic optimal mean block length for the STATIONARY
    block bootstrap (the data-driven choice of `expected_block_length`).

    Politis and White (2004), corrected in Patton, Politis and White (2009),
    select the block length from a flat-top lag-window (Politis and Romano 1995)
    estimate of the spectral density at frequency zero. This is a faithful
    pure-Python transcription of the canonical `arch` implementation
    (`arch.bootstrap.optimal_block_length`, the `_single_optimal_block`
    stationary branch), kept stdlib-only (`math` + builtins) per the analytics
    layer's no-numpy/scipy discipline (ADR 0013 decision 11, ADR 0016 dec 5).

    Algorithm (for a centered series eps of length n):
      - `b_max = ceil(min(3*sqrt(n), n/3))` caps the result.
      - `kn = max(5, int(log10(n)))` is the run length of consecutive lags that
        must be jointly insignificant. (arch uses `int()` here, a floor; its own
        docstring notes a known floor-vs-ceil ambiguity, so this matches the
        reference and is NOT a bug to "fix".)
      - `m_max = ceil(sqrt(n)) + kn` is the largest lag examined.
      - A lag's normalized autocorrelation is `|sum eps_t eps_{t+i}| /
        sqrt(SS_lead * SS_lag)`; the flat-top cutoff is the deliberately wide
        band `cv = 2*sqrt(log10(n)/n)` (wider than the +/- 2/sqrt(n) ACF band,
        so it rejects the isolated boundary-crossing lags that a naive ACF rule
        treats as significant). `opt_m` is the first lag starting a run of `kn`
        insignificant lags; the bandwidth is `m = min(2*max(opt_m, 1), m_max)`.
      - With the flat-top window `lam(k) = 1` for `k/m <= 1/2` else
        `2*(1 - k/m)`: `g = sum_k 2*lam*k*acv_k`, `lr_acv = acv_0 + sum_k
        2*lam*acv_k`, and the stationary optimum is
        `b = (2*g^2 / (2*lr_acv^2))^(1/3) * n^(1/3) = ((g/lr_acv)^2 * n)^(1/3)`,
        capped at `b_max`.

    Returns the RAW optimal mean block length. It can be <= 1.0 for a series the
    flat-top criterion judges indistinguishable from iid (the optimal is then
    the iid bootstrap); the caller owns the bootstrap's `expected_block_length >
    1.0` contract (e.g. `max(2.0, b)` as a conservative minimal-dependence
    floor) and should report the raw value as a diagnostic rather than silently
    flooring it. For a series too short to estimate the spectrum (n < 11, where
    `m_max` would reach `n - 1` and the lag-window partial sums go empty) returns
    1.0 (no detectable dependence assumed).
