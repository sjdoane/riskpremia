"""SQLite WAL-backed trial registry.

Per ADR 0002 decision 19 + acceptance criterion 4: single-machine
concurrent (multiple notebooks plus pytest workers); WAL mode; serialized
writes via SQLite's one-writer lock with a busy-timeout retry. Per ADR
0003 decision 21 (as reconciled by the ADR 0003 amendment footer this PR
adds): the v1 effective-N method is `naive` (the user-declared count of
independent strategy families, supplied at construction); PCA-based
effective-N is deferred to v1.1 because it needs per-trial return-series
storage that this scalar-only schema does not carry.

The registry feeds the Deflated Sharpe Ratio: `effective_n_and_sr_variance`
returns `(n_effective, v_sr)` consumed by `analytics.sharpe.dsr(...,
v_sr=..., n_effective=...)`.

PCA threshold reconciliation (ADR 0003 dec 21 stated both "opt-in for
N>=50" and "with N<30 PCA raises"): in the v1.1 PCA path, PCA is the
recommended method at N>=50, hard-errors below N=30, and the 30-to-50
band is allowed-but-not-default. In v1, PCA is structurally deferred, so
any `method="pca"` request raises `NotImplementedError` regardless of
trial count. `InsufficientTrialsForPCAError` is reserved for the v1.1 PCA
path's genuine low-N case.

        Connection-per-operation: SQLite Connection objects are not safe
        to share across processes, and the concurrency model is
        multi-process (parallel pytest workers + notebooks). Re-asserting
        `journal_mode=WAL` on every connection is idempotent (a no-op once
        the database header records WAL). `busy_timeout` and `synchronous`
        are per-connection and must be set each time.

        `synchronous=NORMAL` is the WAL-recommended setting and is chosen
        deliberately: under WAL it never corrupts the database, but a
        committed transaction can be lost if the OS crashes or power is cut
        before the next checkpoint. For a research trial registry that
        power-loss window is an acceptable durability tradeoff for the
        per-commit fsync it saves over `FULL`.

        Cold-start WAL race: switching a FRESH database into WAL needs a
        moment with no other connection mid-switch, and SQLite's busy
        handler does NOT cover the journal-mode switch itself, so two
        processes cold-starting the registry at once can each raise
        `OperationalError: database is locked` (observed on Linux CI; masked
        on the single-process dev path). The switch is idempotent once any
        process has set WAL, so on a locked switch this closes the connection
        (releasing it so a peer can complete its own switch), backs off by a
        linear delay plus a pid-derived ASYMMETRIC offset (to break the
        symmetric two-process deadlock without a non-deterministic RNG), and
        retries; one process wins the switch and the rest no-op. The
        `timeout=` argument installs the C-level busy handler at connect time
        so ordinary write contention after the switch waits rather than
        erroring.
